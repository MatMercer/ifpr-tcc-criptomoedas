abstract = {This review article presents the system architecture behind most of nowadays cryptocurrencies. Thereby I will focus on the applica-tion scenario of a decentralized cryptocurrency, but also point out the potential for generalization. The architecture was mainly defined by the Bitcoin network, the first and still largest implementation of its kind. I will discuss the components that compile this structure and mention se-curity weaknesses as well as the opportunities for attackers. Furthermore, I outline improvements and detail solutions that had been implemented to cope with the scaling network. Additionally, secondary aspects like privacy and usability are covered.},

@article{Arsov,
abstract = {The tech is already complicated enough, and if the terminologies aren't understood or clarified, it will further compound the complexities in this nascent industry. Everyone needs to know about this revolutionary tech, and as participants of this beautiful ecosystem it is our responsibility to simplify things as best as we can to the masses. The blockchain, the underlying technology, is the biggest innovation in computer science—the idea of a distributed database where trust is established through mass collaboration and clever code rather than through a powerful institution that does the authentication and the settlement. The biggest problems, though, have to do with clear categorization. Addresses (Cryptocurrency addresses) are used to receive and send transactions on the network. An address is a string of alphanumeric characters, but can also be represented as a scannable QR code. Agreement ledgers are distributed ledgers used by two or more parties to negotiate and reach agreement. Altcoin is an abbreviation of " Bitcoin alternative " . Currently, the majority of altcoins are forks of Bitcoin with usually minor changes to the proof of work (POW) algorithm of the Bitcoin blockchain. The most prominent altcoin is Litecoin. Litecoin introduces changes to the original Bitcoin protocol such as decreased block generation time, increased maximum number of coins and different hashing algorithm Attestation Ledgers are distributed ledgers that provide a durable record of agreements, commitments or statements, providing evidence (attestation) that these agreements, commitments or statements were made. ASIC is an acronym for " Application Specific Integrated Circuit " . ASICs are silicon chips specifically designed to do a single task. In the case of bitcoin, they are designed to process SHA-256 hashing problems to mine new bitcoins. Bitcoin is a well known cryptocurrency, based on the proof-of-work blockchain. A blockchain is a type of distributed ledger, comprised of unchangable, digitally recorded data in packages called blocks (rather like collating them on to a single sheet of paper). Each block is then 'chained' to the next block, using a cryptographic signature. This allows block chains to be used like a ledger, which can be shared and accessed by anyone with the appropriate permissions. Block ciphers are a method of encrypting text (to produce ciphertext) in which a cryptographic key and algorithm are applied to a block of data at once as a group rather than to one bit at a time. Block height refers to the number of blocks connected together in the block chain. For example, Height 0, would be the very first block, which is also called the Genesis Block. Block rewards are rewards given to a miner which has successfully hashed a transaction block. Block rewards can be a mixture of coins and transaction fees, depending on the policy used by the cryptocurrency in question, and whether all of the coins have already been successfully mined. The current block reward for the Bitcoin network is 25 bitcoins for each block. A central ledger refers to a ledger maintained by a central agency. Chain linking is the process of connecting two blockchains with each other, thus allowing transactions between the chains to take place. This will allow blockchains like Bitcoin to communicate with other sidechains, allowing the exchange of assets between them A cipher is the algorithm used for the encryption and/or decryption of information. In common language, 'cipher' is also used to refer to an encryption message, also known as 'code'.},

@article{Krishnan2015,
abstract = {Cryptocurrency, a form of digital currency that has an open and$\backslash$ndecentralized system and uses cryptography to enhance security and$\backslash$ncontrol the creation of new units, is touted to be the next step from$\backslash$nconventional monetary transactions. Many cryptocurrencies exist today,$\backslash$nwith Bitcoin being the most prominent of them. Cryptocurrencies are$\backslash$ngenerated by mining, as a fee for validating any transaction. The rate$\backslash$nof generating hashes, which validate any transaction, has been increased$\backslash$nby the use of specialized machines such as FPGAs and ASICs, running$\backslash$ncomplex hashing algorithms like SHA-256 and Scrypt, thereby leading to$\backslash$nfaster generation of cryptocurrencies. This arms race for$\backslash$ncheaper-yet-efficient machines has been on since the day the first$\backslash$ncryptocurrency, Bitcoin, was introduced in 2009. However, with more$\backslash$npeople venturing into the world of virtual currency, generating hashes$\backslash$nfor this validation has become far more complex over the years, with$\backslash$nminers having to invest huge sums of money on employing multiple high$\backslash$nperformance ASICs. Thus the value of the currency obtained for finding a$\backslash$nhash did not justify the amount of money spent on setting up the$\backslash$nmachines, the cooling facilities to overcome the enormous amount of heat$\backslash$nthey produce and electricity required to run them. The next logical step$\backslash$nin this is to utilize the power of cloud computing. Miners leasing super$\backslash$ncomputers that generate hashes at astonishing rates that have a high$\backslash$nprobability of profits, with the same machine being leased to more than$\backslash$none person on a time bound basis is a win-win situation to both the$\backslash$nminers, as well as the cloud service providers. This paper throws light$\backslash$non the nuances of cryptocurrency mining process, the traditional$\backslash$nmachines used for mining, their limitations, about how cloud based$\backslash$nmining is the logical next step and the advantage that cloud platform$\backslash$noffers over the traditional machines.},

@article{Nakamoto2008,
abstract = {A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},
